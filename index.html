      <header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
      <p>This page describes all the organelles of a eukaryotic cell. All organisms are made up of cells. There are two types: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The difference between the two is that prokaryotic cells do not have a membrane-bound nucleus the way eukaryotes do. Furthermore, they lack membrane-bond organelles and have cell walls made of peptidoglycan. Eukaryotic cells are also much bigger than prokaryotic cells.</p>
      <p>The organelles listed in this page include:
      <ul>
        <li>nucleus</li>
        <li>ribosome</li>
        <li>endoplasmic reticulum</li>
        <li>golgi body</li>
        <li>vacuole</li>
        <li>mitochondria</li>
        <li>lysosome</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="nucleus">
    <header><h2>Nucleus</h2></header>
    <p>The nucleus contains the cell's genetic material, DNA. The DNA never leaves the nucleus, but undergoes transcription and translation into mRNA and eventually proteins. DNA contains all the information about the organism, but not all parts of it are continuously on at all times.</p>
    <code>central dogma: DNA -> RNA -> protein</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="ribosome">
    <header><h2>Ribosome</h2></header>
    <p>Ribosomes build proteins by putting together long chains of amino acids according to the mRNA being translated. It is composed of a large subunit and a small subunit.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id="endoplasmic_reticulum">
    <header><h2>Endoplasmic Reticulum</h2></header>
    <p>There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum: the smooth ER and the rough ER. The former puts together lipids and is crucial for making new membranes. The rough ER is aptly named for the ribosomes that are attached throughout the membrane. The ribosomes help with building proteins and the ER helps to fold and modify them.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id="golgi_body">
    <header><h2>Golgi Body</h2></header>
    <p>After proteins are made in the rough ER, they are shipped to the golgi body. This organelle adds the final modifications needed for the protein and then sorts them to send them to their final destinations. Think of this as the post-office for the cell.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id="vacuole">
    <header><h2>Vacuole</h2></header>
    <p>A membrane enclosed sac that can be filled with anything the cell needs to keep separate. This can store food, water, etc. In plants, the vacuole also helps the cell maintain its rigidity.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id="mitochondria">
    <header><h2>Mitochondria</h2></header>
    <p>Famously known for being the "powerhouse of the cell", the mitochondria generates ATP from glucose. ATP is an energy molecule used for every reaction in the cell. It is generated through cellular respiration.</p>
    <p>The process of photosynthesis is outlined by the formula below:</p>
    <code>
      Carbon dioxide + Water --> Glucose (sugar) + Oxygen
    </code><br>
    <code>CO2 + H2O --> C6H12O6 + 6O2</code>
    <p>The process of cellular respiration is outlined by the formula below:</p>
    <code>
      Glucose + Oxygen --> Carbon dioxide + Water + ATP
    </code> <br>
    <code>
      C6H12O6 + 6O2 --> CO2 + H2O
    </code>
  </section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id="lysosome">
    <header><h2>Lysosome</h2></header>
    <p>The lysosome is a membrane enclosed bag of digestive juices. It breaks down large molecules and old cell parts into their components that can be recycled to build new cell parts. Think of it as the recycling center of the cell.</p>
